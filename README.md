## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**

- React
- [Vite.JS](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Tailwind CSS

## Optimizations

Future optimizations are adding Framer Motion for smooth transitions when first showing the page.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this page was a challenge, managing the z-index of different images and styles was difficult but I love the result. I look forward to build more frontend websites!
