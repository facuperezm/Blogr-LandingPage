This is a landing page made with React for Blogr Website.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**

- React
- Tailwind CSS

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write _something_. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations

Future optimizations are adding Framer Motion for smooth transitions when first showing the page.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this page was a challenge, managing the z-index of different images and styles was difficult but I love the result. I look forward to build more frontend websites!

## Examples:
